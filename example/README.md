# Example

This folder contains an example usage of the ContactHub Node.js SDK.

## Running

```ssh
npm i
npm start
```

This will fetch some data from ContactHub and print it to the console.

## Flow

This example also demonstrates how to leverage the Flow type annotations present
in the SDK. Run `npm run flow` to statically check you're calling the SDK
methods with the correct type of parameters. If your text editor supports Flow
integration, you should see automatic type hints while typing.
